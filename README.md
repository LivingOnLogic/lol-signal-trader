# ðŸ“ˆ lol-signal-trader

**Autonomous signal-based trading agent** for the Living On Logic protocol.

This agent reacts to market signals â€” like RSI, sentiment, or moving averages â€” fetched from MCP modules and executes swaps automatically via connected DEX modules.

## âš¡ Overview

`lol-signal-trader` enables fully automated crypto trading based on:

- ðŸ§  Technical signals (RSI, SMA, Bollinger Bands)
- ðŸ’¬ Social sentiment (Twitter, Telegram, Nansen)
- ðŸ›  Modular execution (Uniswap, SushiSwap, etc.)

It is powered by **MCP signal sources** and **DEX execution endpoints**, all coordinated by an agent logic loop.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Configurable signal source and thresholds
- Simple or compound strategy triggers
- MCP-based execution with full trace logging
- Optional dry-run mode for simulation
- Lightweight and extensible
